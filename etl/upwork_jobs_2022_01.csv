The first job offer will be for the first 400 words of an article and I'll hire you for the other 1000+ words if you write the first 400 good. This way I can see your writing skill and how you follow guidelines. If you accept the job I'll let you know how I like my blog articles written and you can decide if you want to accept or not.

All articles will be informational posts only.

For example, I may give you the keyword ""how to survive a bear attack"" and you'll have to write a 1,000+ word blog article on the subject. I expect you to research the topic thoroughly so you can be as helpful as possible to the reader.

Make sure to write pineapple at the beginning of your message to let me know you read the job offer all the way through.

Look forward to hearing from you! 

P.S. My total monthly spending is $1600+ but I'll be hiring multiple writers to fulfill my content needs. This means it's unlikely for you to make the total amount unless you're an exceptional writer who can write 53,000+ words a month. So I guess it's technically possible, just highly unlikely.",CONTRACTOR,"Blog Writing, Content Writing, SEO Writing, Blog Content",United States,,,$12,Entry level,Remote Job,One-time project,"

I am looking for a heatmap style visualization of current self storage facility supply and demand. To start, you can keep this relative to the state of Pennsylvania, USA. 

This may be a tough project that will require several bits of data and the ability to convert that data into a heat map. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a tool that will allow me to find areas of land that have high population density but low amount of self storage facilities. 

You will need to find/create:
1. A list of ALL self storage facilities
2. An accurate estimate of square footage per facility. (This can be done manually by measuring the length/width on Google Maps satellite. View, however, this method is not accurate for two story facilities or facilities that are located inside of other buildings that you can not easily measure the amount of storage square footage by looking at the building footprint. )
3. From 1. and 2. you can build a heatmap of self storage facility square footage density. 
4. A heatmap of population density. 
5. Finally from the previous data sets generate the final ""self storage square foot per capita"" heatmap. 



Could you kindly answer the following questions:
What skills will you require to perform this job? 
What is the budget for the job?
Where will you pull you data? 

Thanks!

2.	Admin section, I will add the Districts/sectors (see #8 for more info)
3.	I can enter a specific community and attached special messages/alerts. (example gate codes, community map, property manager)
A.	As I approach the community, the alerts will pop up to show me the gate codes, property manager’s name, etc..
4.	I can enter a specific address and also flag the address. For example: I want if the address has dangerous people, I can flag it with Dangerous people, or if the house is a half way house, I can flag it half way house. 
5.	Any members can flag an address and it should list who flagged the address and when
6.	Also, any flag that was entered and also be removed.

There may be multiple sets of 2-4, as many as 10.

I only have a $300 budget for this first scene, but this budget will increase as I continue to grow our project. 
I want to build an 'open world' for our game, but need this first map to be much smaller.

I want to find an artist that can help with this small project and show off their skills to get ready for a bigger map!

This map should become your top portfolio piece for you to show off your skills.  :-)

I need a talented and dependable NATIVE ENGLISH (only!) writer to write about digital marketing technology (apps, digital menus, automation services, etc). This will be mostly B2B content. We are looking for someone with experience and solid writing skills. 

We're happy to work on a per-word or per-project basis as opposed to hourly. 

There will be a moderate amount of research involved. The reader needs to get the sense that you're an authority on the topic. 

The tone should be conversational but not stating the obvious--your audience will be pretty well-educated. Overall, the content won't be overly technical but you should provide interesting perspectives/takes on the material. 

We intend for this to be a very long term relationship. We need someone who is ready to be reliable on a weekly basis.

The ideal candidate should be available to write one to two articles per week of around 1000 words. 

We may have other topics for you if you want to take on additional work. 

The test article will be paid as long as it's good enough to publish after some editing!

Provide links to your work in your proposal please!

Feel free to ask questions if you have any. 

Looking forward to potentially working with you! 

Thanks,

It's a series of 5 videos between 1:30min and 2:30min. I've been building out parametric XPresso rigs for the buildings and other elements, locking them down for the storyboards. The voice-over and music is all cut together as well. I also have a rough sample animation (although a number of things will change from this). I need someone who can work on the actual animation in Cinema 4D while I prepare the assets for the next videos. We'll coordinate to find the optimal workflow between us. But my aim is to set things up as much as possible so you can push through them quickly. Then send them back to me to do the AE compositing.

SAMPLE:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iJwWhviMeCUx1ArFlPa42VPm2BovJsPU/view?usp=sharing

DATES:
1st video (the shortest one) is almost through the storyboard and asset stage. Looking to deliver February (likely mid to late, just waiting to confirm this).
The other 4 videos are to be wrapped by June (with enough time to finish compositing for final delivery).

SKILLSET:
The assets are all parametric, made up of booles, extruded splines, cloners and the like. Animation is driven by MoGraph Effectors and Signal plugin (from Greyscale Gorilla). Doesn't have to use Signal but maintaining consistency in animation curves is important. Also using a rudimentary character rig and Mixamo for FBX animations, so familiarity with these is a plus. Trying to limit it to walk cycles and some less complex animations.",CONTRACTOR,"3D Animation, Motion Graphics, Maxon Cinema 4D",Canada,,,,Intermediate,Remote Job,One-time project,"

We worked with a special developer for the maps before and already thought we could launch until we realized a huge bug: we render vector tiles but because of the high detail level it loads too much data and then crashes on mobile. Therefore we need to serve a Raster tiles version.

For this particular thing, there was no frameworks. It is just Node.js, Shell, AWS infrastructure (EC2, S3), Mapbox GL JS a bit, and, importantly, for map tiles generation I use Osmium + OSM and Tippecanoe. To make our own self-hosted general topographic content I would propose to use OpenMapTiles schema - would be good if you already had an experience with that

But, the general overarching task - to make raster .png map tiles from vector .pbf map tiles + Mapbox GL JS Stylesheet which is in .json format.

Possibly, there will be someone knowing how to do it in a different more efficient way. The best would be if we can render raster tiles from vector tiles on-the-fly - then we would not need to rerender everything, etc.

The former developer is not available for longterm work anymore. We are therefore looking for a longterm partner who can help us here and with future adjustments.

The former developer would still be reachable for questions of course.

This script produces output files by calling a Fortran executable (by os.system(example.exe) and that's the difficulty of the task : begin able to launch the script,
call in the same time the executable and manage the generated output file without having interferencies between them.

I provide an archive containing the python original script "" Camb_launcher_XSAF.py"" and the configurations files located in ""QTLauncher"" directory.

Caution : to compile CAMB executable (camb), you need gfortran compiler and do in CAMB-0.1.7 : ""make EQUATIONS=equations_ppf ""

The output files are located in ""WP_Pk"" directory.

The script to parallelize is ""Camb_launcher_XSAF.py"" and I would like to use pool.map from multiprocessing library.

We are looking to add e-commerce to our platform, for digital goods. We are focused on the music industry and would like to add an additional vertical to our platform by allowing our users to sell digital audio files(beats and drum kits) we would like you to analyze our competitors such as beatstars.com and in DEEP detail describe their flows an features. So that we can provide this document to our Development team to implement in our platform. We need someone with coding knowledge so they can explain it in the best language, that our development team will be able to understand and implement. We also, are looking to integrate cryptocurrency as a payment option in our platform, so we need a detailed description of the most efficient way to add this into our platform as well. We currently are using stripe. 

So the main points is to write out a analysis of beatstars.com  (which is a beat marketplace) and their features on how they execute the selling of audio files, displaying and how they handle the specific document(agreements) that correlate with the audio files while purchasing. In short, our development after reading your document should be able to get to work immediately. There is also another platform known as sellfy.com which should also be looked into and analyzed as they allow for the selling of digital goods as well to. 


So the main take aways should Be to analyze beatstars and sellfy feature set and explain the run down of the platform and how the flows an features work. Also, to research and deeply explain the best way to integrate cryptocurrency transactions into our platform(people can pay with crypto) 

You also are to research software that exist ALREADY that we could integrate into our platform to add the E-commerce marketplace feel or crypto currency payment acceptance that we may just have to pay for but would save us tremendous development time as we would just be integrating it into our current code.

Many times, we are given maps of the parking spot numbers and parking spot levels/areas at these buildings, and they are very hard to read. 

I'd like to create our own parking maps, which show all parking spots at these buildings. Some buildings are small and straightforward, while others are large (a complex with multiple buildings and multiple parking areas) or multiple levels. 

I've attached an example of the schematic I received from a building (with spot numbers) and then a very simple map I produced. I'd like something that looks better and can be more consistent in visual style, and that can work well at sites with multiple buildings. 

I'm open to ideas. This could be a long-term project, as we work with buildings like this all the time. Please quote me how much you would charge for a map for a building like the sample I attached as a starting point. 

I don't like the visual design of this example (it looks crappy), but here's an example of the level of detail I'm wanting in our maps: http://ithacarenting.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dt_parking_map_cv_wh_revised-1-1024x824.jpg

I am looking for someone to create a white dotted version of a map.

We believe in delivering a world-class service to our clients without working ourselves to death.

Led by a former United States Army Green Beret, our company believes in working until the mission is complete, and not a minute longer. You'll be led with clear guidance and expectations, but how the mission is accomplished is up to you. Working with us will turn you into the best version of yourself, and pay you well for your contribution.

You can find our company values here:
https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/eUzA1H8B1prrsfjQ4zmxHDRb

We've almost tripled in revenue in the last few months, and we're looking for our next rockstar team member to help us triple it again!

Your work will be fully remote, and you're free to work on your own schedule, as long as you can satisfy the meeting requirements (details below).

Your sole responsibility is launching, optimizing, and scaling Facebook ad campaigns.

We have a Creative Strategist to support you with new images/videos (though your input and new ideas are HIGHLY encouraged), a Senior Strategist to take care of communicating with clients, and a Creative Director to help improve the business as a whole, making it even easier to succeed with paid ads.

Your first 7 days will strictly be onboarding, and getting familiar with our team, our systems, our clients, your role, and our expectations for you.

After that, you'll be up and running inside client accounts, and helping us change the lives of our clients by crushing their revenue and growth goals.

As an added benefit, you'll regularly get access to new courses/training for FREE to help you stay on top of the latest changes and best practices.

At Vybe Media, all we care about is results, and working as little as possible.

We're constantly optimizing our workflows and systems to get more done in less time, because - let's face it - the point of life isn't to work.

We push ourselves to the max when it's required, and then develop systems and processes to make sure we don't have our back against the wall very often.

Here's the person we're looking for:
- Someone who is PROACTIVE. If you see a problem, fix it. If you don't know how, figure it out. If you can't, ask for help. Ignorance is acceptable, inaction is not.

- Someone who takes OWNERSHIP. We will give you very clear guidance on the client's goals and target KPI's. Our ideal person will take those numbers and OWN them, not waiting for someone else to tell them how to improve performance, or revive a struggling account.

- Someone with proven STRATEGIES. You should be able to explain at least 3 different media buying strategies that have worked for you previously, and when you might use them again. We need you to know what to do when things aren't working as planned.

- Someone who is DATA-DRIVEN. You should know the industry standards for CPC, CTR,  ATC %, Purchase %, etc., and you should be able to come up with ideas for improving any of these numbers. We'll support you with new copy, images, landing pages, etc - but we'll be looking for your input on where things are broken, and some possible reasons why.

- Someone who is EXPERIENCED. If you haven't failed on a client account before, you're probably not a good fit. No one wins 100% of the time, and losing can be the best education. You should be just as comfortable managing $100k/month+ as you are managing $3k/month. If you've never wanted to throw your laptop in the trash, or punch Zuck in the face - you haven't been doing this long enough.

- Someone who is HUNGRY. If you aren't dying to add 5-6 new accounts to your day, please don't apply. We're looking for someone who's ready to get after it. Someone who's ready to find out just what they're capable of, and push themselves to the limit.

While we're looking to hire someone in the next 7 days, know that we're going to vet you thoroughly.

The following will get you immediately disqualified:
- Failure to follow instructions as laid out below
- Failure to show up to any appointments/calls
- Reaching out to anyone on our team outside of UpWork

In your cover letter, please include the following:
- Tell us about a time where you demonstrated a proactive attitude instead of waiting for guidance.
- Tell us about a time where a client was unhappy, and you took ownership of the results.
- Tell us about a time where you worked with minimal guidance and achieved solid results
- Tell us what's wrong with each of the following sets of metrics:
(CTR All 10%, CTR Link 1%, CPC $8, ATC % 15%, Pur % 4.5%)
(CTR All 2%, CTR Link 1%, CPC $2, Opt-In % 12%, Pur % 2.5%)
(CTR All 5%, CTR Link 2.5%, CPC $1.50, Opt-In 40%, Lead to Call % 5%)

We look forward to hearing from you, and adding you to our team!

We need to build a simple React app to solve the following problem:

We have images of maps that we need to identify points on using latitude and longitude.

The proposed solution is outlined in the attached diagram. It will work as follows:

1. The user will upload the image of the map
2. The app will display the map
3. The user will click on the map to create points and enter their latitude and longitude.
4. The user will then enter a latitude and longitude of an unknown point.
5. The app will use the lat/lngs of the created points to calculate where the unknown point is located on the map image. It will display a marker on that spot.
5a. Instead of entering lat/lng to search for an unknown point, the user can also enter the address which will then be geocoded to lat/lng.

That's everything the app needs to do. I'm not sure if it needs much of a backend. The images and markers don't need to be saved so no storage or database is needed.

Please let me know what questions you have.

Thanks!

This is a real-time web portal and we have to display multiple pointers on the map and change its color based on real-time data received via TCP or MQTT or HTTP.
On the map, the admin can add pointers (select icon or shape to be displayed) on the map. After entering settings like name, location name, connect type, connection details the data will be saved into the database along with GPS coordinates automatically fetched.
When the user will log in, all these pointers will be displayed on the map. the software will connect with all the connection strings (TCP, APIs, or MQTT) and listen to status data being received.
For example, if the admin will add a pointer, and enter connection details as IP: 192.168.1.1 port:1234, then the software will continuously listen to this IP and port and display a red or green color icon. If software receives the red message, a red icon will be displayed and alert sound will be played.

V2.0 – Stabilize and Upgrade backend of forecast.surfer.com and maps.surfer.com backend (Dot Net + Native ios + native android platform).  I am constantly needing to reboot the EC2 instances.

Resolution:
-Stabilize the .net backend and create new user management portal
• Create new backend CMS to manage users
• Move to a less expensive tier of AWS RDS or another database that is less expensive monthly
• Export all login users and passwords to the new backend CMS (TBD)
• Stabilize all
• The AWS instance keeps timing out, please take a look at the backend and help fix the reason why it keeps timing out.
 
*Considerations:
• Will need to update Stripe, Google Analytics, Mailchimp, Revenuecat, etc
• Will the ios/android apps - need to stabilize 
 
 
V3.0 Map Upgrades
 
3.1) We need to update the images on the (Southern California) react + leaflet maps so that the maps will have higher resolution images. There will be new images (tiles) from AWS s3 to be shown when a user zooms all the way into the screen in these geolocations. See screenshot

 
3.2) ​Add Maps for other regions:
*best source for each new region is tbd
Options: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/marine/
https://www.usno.navy.mil/FNMOC
https://stormglass.io
 
Additional Maps (Add to the maps.surfer.com website)
- Mexico (Will have S3 tiles for this region)
- East Coast
- Caribbean
- South American
- Europe
- Pacific Ocean
- Indonesia

 
Considerations for other new region maps:
* We need to restrict users to see 3 days of free forecasts, beyond that they will need to login and subscribe to access the forecasts via stripe 
* Need to make sure these maps have SEO and receive search traffic
 
 
 
V4.0 – design / new re-imagined a version of the Forecast.Surfer.com Graphs, Favorites and Alerts, Social Feeds
This could be ios/android only (depending on cost)?
 
4.1) – Graphs iOS/android and forecast.surfer.com
**Need to be simple and engaging. Example: meetcarrot.com/weather/
Update the graph view of the forecast
a. The “Day” view needs to be more simple and clean.  
b. The layout should be “simple “, ie a user can quickly view simple forecast, referencing average data for 1am-6am, 7am-12pm, 1pm-6pm, 7pm-12am
c. Simple chart and numerical values. User can then swipe to future/past days
d. Example: Carrot Weather, goepic.surf/  or Surfline.com

 
4.2 Favorites:  Users need an option to favorite a spot or region. *This is currently working in the forecast.surfer.com product and ios/android apps.  We will need to recreate this feature in the new experience. *Add “favorite” option/button to maps.surfer view
Example of current view that needs to be updated (screenshots to follow)

 
4.3 Alerts functionality (needs to be updated).  
*This feature has been a high ask for our users
The alerts should stay active until a user turns them off for a spot. *Ie, once a user sets an alert for a spot, the alert will stay active to listen for future days where conditions align to their specifications. This should be a small change in the code to fix. Alerts work already, they should just stay active until a user modifies or turns them off.
*Add alert icon to maps.surfer
* Show alerts % relative to forecast icon on the maps timeline
 
Examples of current view on the live app  to follow) They will need to be updated or recreated
 

4.4 Social feeds (The “social feeds” should be almost ready to go live in the bitbucket code.  There will be Instagram galleries for each surf spot from the flockler API.   **We will need to talk through this if there are any issues with Flockler.
 
*The social posts from that spot will reference the “timestamp” of that images post date. When a user looks at that image, they will see the surf, wind, etc conditions from that date/time.  (From Stormglass api)
*A user will be prompted to set an alert to listen to when these conditions may happen in the future.  *A user can modify the alert settings, since the social post may not have the exact parameters for an alert.
 
 

 
 
V5.0  iOS/Android Updates
Add maps from maps.surfer.com to ios/android mobile apps
a. Add map icon in the mobile app bottom nav (will send map icon)
b. Relaunch new ios/android apps with graphs and maps above
c. Add paid option on ios/android apps to see the maps. (use the same 3 days free and the other days paid as we have on maps.surfer.com)
d.

Many of my clients need bespoke and custom illustrations or watercolor layouts of their wedding venue.

Others want custom maps, crests or line drawings and illustration. I am looking for artists that are available for several back to back projects as clients book for 2022/23. 

I am currently happily working with an artist on UpWork but am sending too much work and need a few more outlets. Once you offer something in your portfolio for one client, everyone wants to add that on - and that is my problem.. but a good one.

In 2022, I am also looking to extend designs and hire out for small skylines, watercolor and line illustration of popular venues and elements for my company on products I want to launch.

I would love to get your price structure and to see if you are available for several projects and what your lead time is per project. I am happy to work with beginners, intermediate and expert artists. My clients have different budgets. 

Current projects that I need help for:

(1) Small illustrated map. I can typeset all the wording for the client so we can go over a series of proofs. I can currently outsourcing all of my maps to a company and turning away map work mostly.

(3) Wedding venue - watercolor or hand drawn with proper watercolor filter/Procreate/Photoshop

(1) Illustration from wedding venue 

(4) Projects for my company for expansions on products I sell that are not client specific that include 3x3 city layouts, skylines, watercolor venues and different layouts that could be used for international projects. 

Turn over: 

Digital ready files via PNG or JPG

Ability to work with artist if client has any minor changes like adding a little sky or adding snow on a mountain or slight modifications that I cannot make myself on color adjustments in Photoshop. (Most clients are very happy with a first rendition). What is your fee for ongoing adjustments for difficult clients? 

Examples of current client work going to print in December are attached.

We have two lists of words. 
List #1 - has 10,000 ""free style"" text entries describing people's job titles. While in general similar jobs have similar texts, they usually never look the same. 
E.g.: ""customer success manager, support"", ""customer success associate"", ""customer success representative I"", ""customer success representative II"", ...  - are all ""customer success"". This is of course a simple example.

List #2 - has a list of 100's of ""organized"" job titles which we want to use.

The ask is to build the code that for each item in List #1 finds what is the item in List #2 that is the most similar in terms of text and meaning.

A followup task will be - for each line in List #1, extract the implied seniority of the title out of a predefined range (associate, manager, director, C-level, ...).

We use Databricks and Spark as our infrastructure.

My team is working on a product value calculation model. I’ve got local working code, which creates DataFrame from Hive-Tables and then goes through a features transformation model and scores according to three models (one model for one pair of products (base product and secondary product)) and with the final formula it calculates the required values.
We found out that we cannot use the current version of the code because it uses a lot of pandas_UDF (SPARK 2.4), but we have to use SPARK 2.2. So I have to rewrite the current code to adapt to the structure of RDD using mappartitions. This code has to launch with spark2_submit, so it is expected to be more or less optimized. During the analysis of the code, I found a large number of eval/exec. Those are not acceptable because of security reasons and have to be replaced.

So the task is this:
1) move from pandas_udf to RDD + mappartitions (since we cannot change PKL file, then it looks like there has to be a DF -- RDD -- DF change).
2) get rid of eval/exec.
3) this code will work in a cluster with the spark2_submit.

My name is Chris and I'm a junior doctor currently compiling an anatomy question bank for  medical students I tutor. Currently my question bank is around 800 questions long, with references to our core textbook, and detailed explanations for more of the questions. 

We will be willing to pay for your hourly contributions (as a guide we would expect you're able to produce anywhere from 5 to 15 or so questions per hour - however we expect this will vary based on content complexity).

The questions will be used for medical students, junior doctors and trainees (from an undergraduate to postgraduate level). 

We also hope to add pathology/physiology resources in future

I'm after your help in expanding my question bank, so I can help more students.

Don't worry if you have no anatomy expertise - my questions are inspired by paraphrasing/referencing our core surgical anatomy textbook, which will obviously be provided by virtue of a free, common use PDF file upon acceptance of this job.

I'm willing to offer your a fee per question, after a short 5 question trial, to ensure we're the right fit for each other. 

What the Job Involves:
- Reading a paragraph/ section of the anatomy textbook to be provided (written in English)
- Write a question with:
   - Statement/ broad question 
   - Followed by four true/ false stem questions, numbered 1 to 4, relating to the topic, with false answers marked
       - Each of this type of question can have any combination of true or false responses (i.e. true/false/false/false; true/false/true/false, etc...)
   - Reference included in the question to the exact page from the book that the topic can be located (just a page is fine). 
   - Short explanation based upon the text is useful, but not mandatory for all questions - this need not be detailed, but can be short (paraphrased) excerpts from the text.

Alternatively, questions can also be a short statement, with five options and only one correct answer (one of A-E). An example of this type of question is seen in example 2.

========

[Example 1 ] 
182. 
The Pronator teres: p87
1. Is a muscle of the deep flexor group of the forearm [True]
2. Receives innervation from the ulnar nerve [True]
3. Comprises two heads, which entrap a terminal branch of the brachial plexus [False]
4. Is deep to the radial artery [False] 

Pronator teres features in the superficial flexor group of the forearm. It comprises two heads (humeral and ulnar heads), with the radial artery superficial to the humeral head, median nerve sandwiched between both heads and the ulnar artery deep to the ulnar head. 

It is innervated by the highest muscular branch of the median nerve (C6,7 roots specifically). 

Of note, the median nerve may give proximal innervation to the pronator teres, in which case it may be said to occasionally therefore have an innervation of a muscle in the arm.

========

[Example 2] 
144.
Which structure pierces the lateral intermuscular septum of the arm? p80
A. profunda brachii artery
B. brachial artery
C. ulnar collateral artery
D. median nerve
E. ulnar nerve

The lateral intermuscular septum is pierced by the radial nerve (C5,6,7,8,T1) which is derived from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, as well as the profunda brachii artery (anterior descending branch). It provides attachment for the medial head of the triceps (posterior to the septum), as well as the extensor carpi radialis longus and brachioradialis (anterior to the septum).

=======
Note both questions are equally valid and both will be remunerated equally!

What I'm looking for:
- Good handle of English is essential - needs to be able to interpret the provided surgical anatomy textbook. I'll be proofreading each question personally, but if correcting mistakes takes longer than it would take for me to write a question myself, then this job mightn't be a good fit for you.
- Creativity - making questions can be time consuming, and keeping my students interest is of paramount importance. Hence you'd ideally need to be versatile in mixing up the order of correct answers/ ways of phrasing each question.

I appreciate it can be difficult to determine what's important to include in a question, particularly if you're not medical, however the book provided does a good job of signposting the important bits. 

Finally, you'd need to be willing to surrender the IP rights to written works so that they can be disseminated amongst the medical students I tutor in and around my city. 

I'm happy to discuss any element of this job further if it's of interest to you! Thanks for taking the time to read my brief.

I have it almost completely built, but there a few technicalities with which I need assistance.

The site contains a D3 TopoJSON U.S. county map with data interactivity. The following issues are outstanding:

1. Map zooms in on double-click but it is not easy to zoom out, zoom does not necessarily work on mobile, and pan can move the map out of view entirely.
2. The divs and styling for the map do not appear to render size properly on Safari, Opera, IE... they work well on Chrome and Firefox.
3. I would like to add zoom in/ zoom out/ reset buttons that apply the functionality from 1.
4. I would like to refactor the code for populating the legend, so that moves/resizes automatically on window drag (these work correctly if you click from within a window, but if you click then drag the window size, the divs break down).
5. Related to 4, I would like the legend text to resize automatically to fit and never overflow.
6. If possible, I would like to animate the transitions of the map and legend divs when the legend div appears on county click.
7. There appear to be minor issues in Open Graph metadata tags such that the image does not appear in iMessage, and there are issues with it on Facebook and LinkedIn.

I do not anticipate these fixes will involve much time or labor for a skilled D3/web design specialist.

We are a charity for saving food, We are taking food from multiple locations and delivering it to people who live in poverty on the town (food surplus),

We have more than 2000 families which means we have more than 2000 locations across the town.

we have 12 drivers who cooperate in delivering the food for the families 

Usually, each driver deliver the meals to approximately 20 families/locations each day 

So, We need to create or develop a program that we can share our families with drivers 

We have all the data for our families who register with us for example names, cellphone, area name, and 20% of them we have the pin location.

Aggregation:
1- we need to be able to add the name of the family and their numbers
2- we need to let our drivers can add the location through Google map address to make it easy for next delivery for any drivers
3- the admin can stop the location changes any time 
4- we able to add/delete more families 
5- Able the driver to add the number of the meals when delivery 
6- we need to be able to classify each family depending on their poverty. ex. the red list need daily food, yellow they need just vegetable or meat, and green who need just food from the grocery (not used food) 
7- can the driver put a note for example the location is wrong, the family doesn't answer, the cellphone is close... 
8- we need to know(daily) how many deliveries each month for each family
9- we need to pick a particular family who calls us for help and needs food urgently 
10- we able to put the families on group depending on the area on the town 
11- can the drivers use the information from their cellphone and can add and edit depending on the admin permission.
12. Able to assign one area or group for one or two drivers. 
13- not all drivers can access all our families.
14-we can have a statistical boar for, today/weekly delivery and meals number.

So... some kind of ""visit website"" and then website crawler for an email address in the code, or some kind of brute force grab the URL and add info@ or contact@ or admin@ marketing@ and running the guessed emails through an email scrubbing system. Or, something you know and I don't know to get the result I'm looking for. 

Then dumps files into CSV format, or into google sheets - I'd prefer google sheets but maybe this complicates/costs too much time for me to pay for Idk. 

My goal is to collect great list data to begin email marketing to. It must be done through business listings because I'm going to be selling them a service for their business listing and it's important I get the contact info this way for the marketing style I'm doing.

Business Capabilities describe the high-level abilities of a company (represented by boxes) that are structured in a hierarchical order and can have multiple levels (depth). Attached, you find a screenshot of a static PowerPoint implementation that shows you exactly what I need. This map contains three levels of capabilities (e.g. level 1: ""Strategic Management""; level 2: ""Strategy Development""; level 3: ""Define Strategy""). The maximum number of levels should not exceed 5.

I would be glad if the visual representation within PowerBI is as close to the given one as possible. But I am also open to other visual representations or other Microsoft tools (MS Visio?) if necessary.

I have the following functional requirements for the interactive Dashboard:
The business capabilities will be stored/edited in a table structure (Name, ID, parent-child-relation, probably further data fields later...). This table must be imported and interpreted by PowerBI, so that no manual editing of the map is necessary if further capabilities are added, removed, or relocated. Please provide a corresponding Excel table with dummy data for this dashboard.
I need a slicer feature, to filter or highlight capabilities based on their properties. E.g. I want to annotate capabilities regarding high criticality and low criticality. I want to be able to have a slicer element to highlight respectively fade-out/grey-out filtered capabilities in the dashboard. The same should be possible for continuous values (e.g. a heatmap based on properties within a range of 0-100).
As in the given PPT example, I want to be able to define the style/color of the capabilities within the source table. This is for a higher visual appeal towards the audience.

I expect a PowerBI-file that contains the dashboard including the slicer elements so that I can edit it further on my own. Furthermore, I also need an Excel file with some dummy data, that I can, later on, replace with the actual business capabilities.

You will be given a movie to which you must write a summary/synopsis and turn it into a story for a video. The story must be fluent and cover the main points of the film.

The story has to be linear. You can not just describe what happens on the screen, you have to add context.

In my work I have a lot of Linux servers to migrate from one provider to another one. Often I've no access to the hypervisor from the source datacenter so I was wondering if it's possible to develop a tool similar to the r1soft (but this noe is designer only for backup needs)

- Inside the VM, as a kernel module, track all the changed sector of the file system disks. There's already some modules to do it (llvm or dm-era) (https://www.cloudandheat.com/block-level-data-tracking-using-davice-mappers-dm-era/) but I can't change the working configuration of the source file system.
- Deploy a VM with the same disks configuration on a target infrastructure
- Sync the changed sectors between the 2 servers (with the exception of course of swap, logical devices and the IP con that should be custom) 
- When the cue is almost 0...turn off the first server and turn on the second one.

(3) Select map style from pre-sets. Draft styles have already been created in Mapbox Studio by us that you can use. At least two styles will be based on WMS. 
(4) Select the layout of the poster from pre-sets, such as the location of text/labels, frames around map, map in shape of circle/house/key etc. These layouts need to be developed by you. Expect around 8 styles, and input is provided by us. 
(5) Add an icon on the map, such as a house, hart, or location icon. 
(6) Change map orientation (portrait, landscape)
(7) Personalize titles and subtitles
(8) Select materials (poster, dibond, acrylglass)
(9) Select size (which differ per material). Update preview of the map after size has been changed.
(10) Select hanging systems for certain materials
(11) Update prices based on chosen material, size and options
(12) Administrator (me) should preferably have the possibility to generate maps without creating an order (we like to use the tool to design a map of for example New York and add it as a standard product or for marketing purposes)
(13) Work well on desktop, tablet and smartphone. On Smartphone the map should stay visible as much as possible, so no endless scrolling up and down to see the effect of a change on the map. We prefer a tab/step system that guides the customer through the options. 

Backend 
(1) Generate an order from the custom designed map, store the order in Shopify and let the customer pay (can use existing checkout and paying options). 
(2) Generate high resolution image file of exact layout of the map as designed by the customer which will be used to print the poster
(3) Add additional materials, sizes and hanging systems
(4)  Adjust prices 
(5) Add new map styles from for example Mapbox Studio or WMS to be used by customers on Frontend. 

Optional 
(1) Create a map with a route (for example flights from city to city, or a road trip)

(2) Besides the styles we currently have in Mapbox Studio and a few WMS styles we are also considering to create and host our own tileserver with mapstyles. We might do this part by our own, but if you have experience with Linux VPS, PostGIS, Geoserver, maptiler, and Openstreetmap/Mapnik you might contribute to this part as well. This is probably more something for the second half of 2022, but we would like to continue working with one freelancer if possible. 

Budget: We realize this is not a small project, but we are a small startup with limited personal resources. We prefer to agree on a fixed price, but that's open for discussion.
Timeline: No high time pressure. If spreading work over longer time reduces costs than that is preferable. But to give an idea: Q1/Q2 of 2022 is fine. 

You might have (many) questions to get a clear picture about this project. We like to hear them and answer them to the best of our knowledge. It is very important for us to have a common understanding about the work to avoid wrong expectations from either side. In your reply we like to read about your previous experience, and how you are going to make a succes of this project. We would also appreciate a first indication of the estimated project costs. 

If after reading this project description you feel just as exited as we are, we would love to hear from you!

I will send the materials after reviewing portfolios. So for now, just give a ballpark estimate for the initial bid. (If you prefer to do this on an hourly basis that is possible. By the way, the average hourly rate shown is not representative because several of my previous contracts involved lawyers!)

Note that this does not involve detailed graphics editing to create new content. Instead you will be making a few enhancements to existing images.

The main work will be to annotate an existing map to highlight why there are problems in the client's current location. This will involve the following steps:
- Add six phrases (e.g., ""waste"" and ""more waste"") in large prominent font.
- Impose image for nearby business (e.g., the review summary from Google Maps),
- Add a few icons to make more intuitive (e.g., dump trucks).
I'll supply all the images, so you will be mainly combining them and adding text.

You will also create a separate version of the map with space for 'from' and 'to' addresses. The result will be formatted so that it fits on the front of a 8x11"" envelop. It will also be used inside as a glossy attachment (full page).

The other graphics work will just involve adding captions to images for incorporation into a document. This should be editable with Microsoft Word, but PDF would be fine.

Summary of work:
1. Full-sized annotated Google Map of business location w/ a few textual annotations and icons.
2. Reduced version including 'from' and 'to' address text annotations
   [to be printed on full-sized envelop sticker paper].
3. 2 pages of half-page attachments: 2 maps and 2 search results.
4. 1 full-page attachment: web search results in landscape mode
   [to be printed on full-sized envelop sticker paper].
Note: 1 is the main task; 2 is slight variation of 1, and, 3 & 4 involve adding captions to existing images.

DISCLAIMER :)

I'm not looking for someone to deal with my orders or any fulfillments tasks or mapping the products.

I'm looking for someone who can solve my syncing issue between Oberlo & DSers


Here's the situation : there is a Shopify store using Oberlo to do drosphipping.

Now the store uses DSers.

But all the mapping is missing.

The sync button has been used (this one https://ibb.co/vPhytVT) but most of the products have not been synced (like 99%).

There's a explanation message mentioning the potential causes of the non-sync (this one https://ibb.co/Gtjmypv).

The issue is that it's impossible that those reasons lead to 99% not being synced.

In order to filter out low-quality freelancers, please start your application message by “OBERLO2DSERS”. If you don't, you will drastically reduce your chances.

Indeed, a freelancer who will have taken the time to read thoroughly this job description is what we are looking for.

Also, please ask the questions you may have and make an offer (I put 50$ for the sake of having an offer but I'm open to the discussion).

Looking forward to reading your application message!

P.S. : I will provide the Loom I shared with DSers chat support to the people who will apply ""correctly"".

Responsive. ,2021-12-26T23:44:23.236Z,"We need to find someone who can help us build an interactive map for a brand. The map would look and feel something like this.

https://bitsummit.org/gaiden-map/

The idea is that each ""category"" of products is an island on a map. You can click on the map and it will take you to a regular section. The map is just the initial interaction.  So let's say we have 4 categories (islands). Chocolate, candy, sour and spicy.

North island is chocolate.
South island is candy.
etc....


When you put your mouse on the Chocolate Island, there may be some interaction like an animation or a title showing up, or something. But when you click on it, it will simply go to the regular chocolate products category. So all the interaction is within the map.

In the example you can zoom in and out and drag left and right.  This is fine, but not necessarily what we want. 

The big things are

- The map and island should stack in mobile version. In this example the map does not stack. It reacts like a regular map that you can still drag to navigate. The one we need requires responsiveness. 
- Big focus on performance. The example I think uses SVGs. The faster it loads, the better.
- The interactive map will live in a Wordpress site. This doesnt mean we need you to build a plugin. We can setup the code within a container, and have it call whatever JS we need. But it must live in a Wordpress site.
- We will provide graphics.

The project is still in early stage. But we need to find the right person first, so we can start the project with the right foot.

If you can find an example that you think is similar to what we are looking for, and you think you can do, you may also provide it.

We are looking for someone who can code this map, basically.

We need a person, an estimated budget. Proof that you can take us where we need. We will go with hourly rate so you can get paid weekly and we can make/see progress.

3- block
4- Plot

so I want for example if I choose City X, I want to map interact with the user, it'll zoom to the location and show the polygon of the city, and so goes on for the other fields.
